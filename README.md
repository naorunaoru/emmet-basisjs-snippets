# Template snippets for [basis.js](https://github.com/basisjs/basisjs)

## Prerequisites
- Any text editor with Emmet support (e. g. Atom, Sublime Text, etc)
- Emmet itself

## Installation
Copy `snippets-basisjs.json` to Emmet's extensions folder (`~/emmet` by default).

Make sure that you have xhtml mode for html enabled. You can use provided `profiles.json` (needs to be in the extensions folder too).

## Documentation
The file itself is pretty much self-documented. You can find more info [here](http://docs.emmet.io/customization/snippets/).
